One of the main properties of these materials is the existence of a phase transition at a certain temperature, which separates two different behaviors of the material. Above this temperature, referred to as the \"critical temperature\" or \"Curie temperature,\" magnetic materials are in a paramagnetic state where electron spins are randomly oriented. As the temperature decreases, these spins begin to align, forming groups with the same orientation, leading to different magnetic domains. Below the Curie temperature, magnetic materials exhibit spontaneous magnetization, causing the mentioned domains to grow larger until all spins achieve the same orientation.\n","\n","In this work, we will consider the two-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions. Only two possible spin orientations are considered: spin up and spin down. The model's arrangement will be a grid of spins with dimensions $L \\times L$, where each of the $L^2 = V$ spins can take two values:\n","\n","$S = \\begin{cases}\n","+1 & \\text{if the spin is up} \\\\\n","-1 & \\text{if the spin is down}\n","\\end{cases}$\n","\n","The system's Hamiltonian is given by the following expression:\n","$H = -J \\sum_{\\langle i, j \\rangle} S_i S_j - H \\sum_{i=1}^V S_i \\quad (1)$\n","\n","Here, $J$ is a constant representing ferromagnetic interaction strength. It can be factored out of the sum due to nearest-neighbor interactions (on a square lattice, a spin only interacts with its top, bottom, right, and left neighbors) and equal magnitudes for all pairs. Additionally, the sign of $J$ determines the magnetic properties of the material: if $J$ is positive, the material exhibits ferromagnetic behavior, while if it's negative, the behavior is antiferromagnetic. The first summation is taken over all possible pairs of spins $\\langle i, j \\rangle$, and $H$ represents an external magnetic field.\n","\n","In the absence of an external magnetic field, which is the case we'll consider, we can omit the second term of Equation (1).\n","\n","Each set of $L \\times L$ spins is referred to as a configuration. There are many possible different configurations of the 2D Ising network, but some are more likely to appear than others. Let's consider a specific configuration $C_\\alpha$. The probability of encountering this configuration depends on its energy and temperature and is given by:\n","\n","$p(C_\\alpha) = \\frac{1}{Z(\\beta)} e^{-\\beta H(C_\\alpha)} \\quad (2)$\n","\n","Here, we've defined $\\beta = (k_B T)^{-1}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, taken to be 1 throughout this work. $Z$ is the partition function, defined as per Equation (11), where the summation spans all possible configurations:\n","\n","$Z(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{\\sum_C e^{-\\beta H(C_\\alpha)}} \\quad (11)$\n","\n","In addition to energy, another relevant quantity for configurations is magnetization. We mentioned earlier that during a phase transition, below the Curie temperature, spontaneous magnetization appears. Its significance stems from being the order parameter in the transition. Magnetization and its intensive magnitude can be defined as follows:\n","\n","$M = \\sum_j S_j \\quad \\text{and} \\quad m = \\frac{1}{V} \\sum_j S_j \\quad (3)$\n","\n","In other words, magnetization is the sum of all spins. Considering that in the paramagnetic state, spins have random orientations, the expected value of magnetization is 0. However, in the ferromagnetic state, all spins align to create an ordered configuration, and the intensive magnetization is expected to have a value of +1 or -1, depending on the preferred orientation direction of the spins: up or down."],"metadata":{"id":"eUZEFTWomRiI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Main imports"],"metadata":{"id":"Y1amLVqJn2Dh"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2DgzRSLIjWOI"},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import random\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import datetime\n","'''\n","Tensorflow libraries\n","'''\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers\n","from tensorflow.keras import optimizers\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D,BatchNormalization"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"n5ickkACQPH_"},"source":["# Auxiliary functions and global variables\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bLP-8ZHwQQ9m"},"source":["def show_ising_config(n, m, x, y,L):\n","    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9, 13))\n","    columns = n\n","    rows = m\n","    ax = []\n","    for i in range(columns*rows):\n","        img = np.transpose(x[i,:].reshape([L,L]))\n","        #
